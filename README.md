# Universal-Save-As-AHK
An AutoHotKey script that provides a single key combo to trigger "Save As" functionality across many applications.

# Overview

In nearly all Windows applications, "Save" is almost universally triggered by the key combination Ctrl + S. "Save As", despite being nearly as important, behaves nowhere near as consistently.

Where available, this script will bind "Save As" function to the key combination Ctrl + F12.
